## **Testing the APIs**
You can test the APIs using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**. Hereâ€™s an example workflow:

1. **Register two users**:
   - Register `player1` and `player2` using the `/api/register/` endpoint.

2. **Log in as `player1`**:
   - Use the `/api/login/` endpoint to get an access token.

3. **Create a game**:
   - Use the `/api/games/` endpoint to create a game between `player1` and `player2`.

4. **Make moves**:
   - Use the `/api/moves/` endpoint to make moves alternately for `player1` and `player2`. The `symbol` (`X` or `O`) will be automatically assigned.

5. **Fetch game details**:
   - Use the `/api/games/<game_id>/` endpoint to check the current state of the game, including the game board.

6. **Fetch game history**:
   - Use the `/api/history/` endpoint to see all games played by a user.
